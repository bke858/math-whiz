		<p id="transcripts">Okay, let’s look at a problem 3/12 + 5/12. Now one thing to remember any time we are adding or subtracting fractions is that the denominators have to match. 
		If they don’t match that means they’re not the same. So let’s just experiment for a second.  Let’s imagine 
		that 3/12 and that three is actually three oranges and then we are going to add the five. But this time we aren’t going to make it oranges and oranges because remember they have to match. 
		In this case we are going to say five people. So if we wanted to add those together, that would be really weird because then we would get eight orange-people. Have you ever seen an orange person before? I haven’t! So that’s not possible. We can’t add the denominators together. What were saying is there’s either eight oranges or there’s eight people but you can’t have eight orange people. So for this example you have to see that our 12ths can’t be added together because that’s not telling us 12 plus 12.  It’s telling us the size of the piece. So we could draw a little picture to represent the 12ths. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4…we need one more. Okay. This has our 12 total pieces. Now let’s say we want to say that Todd had three oranges that he bought from a basket at a farmer’s market that had oranges. And then we want to say Roger bought five of those 12 oranges that were in that basket at the farmer’s market. So that’s going to give us a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 oranges but  still out of only 12. So in our equation of 3/12 plus 5/12 our denominator never ever changes. It always stays the same. So when adding fractions or subtracting and they have the same denominator all you have to do is keep the denominator the same and then add the top. 3 plus 5 equals 8 and then your all done. 
		Plus that matches our model so that we know we’re correct. </p>
