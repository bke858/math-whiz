			<p>So you think you'll never use this strategy in real life? 
			Watch the video to see a few examples of how adding and subtracting fractions
			with like denominators can be used in everyday life.Remember to remove the mouse from the 
			video frame so that you can see the entire movie image.</p>

			<p id="transcripts">Here’s an example of adding fractions in the real world. Everybody says pizza and fractions go together right? So let’s look at an example with adding. So tonight I did not want to cook. Let’s just say it was one of THOSE days…So I made an executive decision to order some pizza. Anyway! We had a delicious dinner but now it’s time to  clean up. 
			What do you do at your house? Well at our house we usually put the extra pieces into one box and then throw that puppy 
			in the fridge for a midnight snack. I mean it wouldn’t really make sense to try to keep all the boxes right, especially if you have like seven boxes. There’s only so much room for pizza in the fridge. So how much pizza do we have now that I’ve put the pizza all in one box?
			For the mushroom and pepperoni pizza I have 4 slices out of the original 8 that came in the box. And for the pepperoni and meat, I had 3 pieces out of the original 8. So now I have 7 pieces in one box that will only fit 8 slices. That’s perfect! Guess what we just did! 
			We added two fractions! 3/8 + 4/8 gave us a total of 7/8 of a pizza left after my family demolished the rest. So what did you notice happened to the denominators? Check out the next video to see exactly how we added these two fractions.
