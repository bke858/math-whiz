				Let’s look at an example on how to divide fractions in the real world. 
				
				
				I bought this blueberry streusel bread to take to a little get together with a couple of friends for Thanksgiving.  But my 3 year old son really wanted some of it and I just can’t tell him no. So I cut off 1/4 of the pumpkin bread so that he could have some for breakfast for  the next couple of days. But now I’m worried that I won’t have enough for my friends. Right now I have 3/4 of the blueberry bread and I need to share it with my three friends and me of course! I need to figure out how big a piece everyone would get and if that’s big enough or if I should go ahead and buy another loaf. Right now I only have three pieces. So that’s not going to work to share with four people.  So what could I do? We would need to divide. I’d need to cut it up into smaller pieces that are even. If I cut it up long ways in four sections then everyone would have the same amount. So let’s see…one person would get three pieces out of 16 possible pieces because if we have to count the missing portion of the bread that Wes will eat. So even though we only see 12 pieces we still have to think about that other piece of 1/4 that we removed earlier. So I went ahead and drew our berry bread so that we could get an idea of what a model of that would represent but remember I got rid of 1/4 and I gave it to my son, Wes, because he was starving. So I actually only had 3/4 to share with my friends whenever I go that Thanksgiving party. So if I’m going to share this pumpkin bread we got to figure out is it enough. So I drew a little picture to see how we would show what we already did with the berry bread in real life. So we’d actually have to split it up between the four people. So I’m just going to pretend that this is my knife cutting up this four ways— one way, two ways, three ways, four ways. When we’re dividing, that’s going to be represented with our original 3/4 because that’s our total. 3/4 berry bread and we are going to divide that by four people that we are sharing it with. Remember, anytime you are dividing by a whole number we have to make it into a fraction if the other one is a fraction. So then we look  at how much the top person has, which they have, one, two, three pieces out of a total of how many pieces? 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So one person is going to get 3/16 of berry bread. Which I think is okay because you know, we are going to have plenty of other food too. But we definitely want to check to make sure that even though we have already done this with the real berry bread when we do it just with an algorithm it works. So remember the rule for fractions, we have to keep the first fraction exactly the same. So we are just going to KEEP it as 3/4. The division sign we going to CHANGE it to a multiplication sign and then for the four over one we have to FLIP it upside down and make it one fourth. Well then it becomes a multiplication problem which we already saw earlier and all we have to do is multiple across which gives us 3/16. Do they match? Yes they do! You are right and we know how to divide fractions.
