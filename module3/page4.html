			<p id="transcripts">Let’s look at an example from real life of when we would need to multiply fractions. Let’s take Thanksgiving for example—It’s coming up pretty quick and this year I’m cooking a turkey
			I think I found the perfect recipe it tells me that if I want to cook it just
			right I need to cook the turkey at 350 degrees for 1/3 of an hour for each pound the turkey weighs. So I’m at the grocery store and I want to figure out how long its going to take to cook this turkey. I don’t want one that too big and I don’t I want to find one that’s just right—Hey,What about this one? 11 –11.5 pounds. Hmm…I think we could work with that. So that means I would need to take this turkey, which was about 12 pounds, and multiply it times 1/3 to see how many hours I would need to cook this turkey. 
			Okay, so let’s see how we would actually write this situation out. We have our 12 pounds of turkey and we know that every 1/3 hour is going to be one pound of turkey. So let’s draw a picture just so we can get a better understanding. So I’m just going to draw a model and represent my 12 pounds. Okay, so this is twelve pounds of turkey. It doesn’t look as delicious as I would like. And we know that for each pound or per pound its going to take 1/3 of an hour. So this pound is 1/3, this pound is 1/3, this pound is 1/3, and so forth, for all of these. So what we’re seeing here is if were going to say 1/3 hour plus 1/3 hour plus 1/3 hour, that would give us our 12 our total hours but that’s a whole lot of adding also known as repeated addition. Repeated addition means to multiply. So we can really just say 12 times 1/3 but remember anytime multiply a whole number times a fraction we have to do it. We have to turn that whole number into a fraction. So we have 12 times one which is 12 and 1times 3 which is three. So we have 12 thirds hour…hmm…That’s a little weird I still don’t know how long its going to take me. But I do remember that this dash can be a division sign as well and we can read this as 12 divided by 3. Well 12 divided by 3, we all know that that’s four. So it’s going to take us four hours to cook
			that turkey. That seems like a perfect amount of time.
