			keep change flip yeah that’s the action everybody's gonna know how where dividing fractions keep change flip yeah that's the action everybody's gonna know how we're dividing fractions keep change flip yeah that's the action everybody's gonna know how where dividing fractions keep change flip yeah that’s the action everybody's going to know how we’re dividing fractions 
			Adding fractions is easy that's no lie you just flip one yup then you multiply don't flip both because that will be strange you need to keep one exactly the same YEAH…then the sign gets change division to multiplication that's okay
			then flip the second fraction like your on a grill
			we multiply what's left that’s really real take 3/5 divided by two-thirds Keep, change, flip—that’s the word. Oh keep three fifths the same change then change sign so we multiply that's the game flip two-thirds we get 3 over 2 then we can multiply and so should you. 3 times 3 is 9, 2 times 5 is 10. 9/10 can’t reduce so that’s the end. 
			Why do we flip it? I'll explain the math dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by have half— 20 students in your class divided by 2  would be ten students
			 all we can do
			 20 students in your class times half is 10  
			 You see you get the same thing at the end. Dividing is multiplying by the reciprocal. Keep, change, flip yeah that’s the simple rule 
			Keep, change, flip yeah that's the action everybody's gonna know how we’re dividing fractions
			Keep, change, flip yeah that's the action everybody's gonna know how we’re dividing fractions
			Keep, change, flip yeah that's the action everybody's gonna know how we’re dividing fractions
			Keep, change, flip yeah that's the action everybody's gonna know how we’re dividing fractions

			Multiply Fractions Song: 
			(Chorus)
			With the numbers in the numerator:
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			and the ones in the denominator:
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			When you're multiplyin' fractions just:
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			I got the temp turned down and my SmartBoard's gone
			and the only way to learn is listen to this song
			
			(Verse 1)
			I'm a nice dude, with some big dreams.
			But first I gotta do, all these fractions things.
			What if I had the fraction, 2 over 5,
			and then another one, and had to multiply?
			Like takin 2/5, and 1 over 3.
			If I multiplied 'em, just what would it be?
			Let me grab a pencil and a piece of paper.
			I'm gonna write this down so I don't forget it later:
			Multiply the numbers up in the numerator.
			Then do the same with the denominator.
			For our problem, start with 2 times 1.
			Now the top half's finished but we're still not done.
			Down on the bottom we got 5 times 3.
			Last time I checked that'll give us 15.
			2/15 now I try to simplify.
			Looks like I can't so sing the chorus right.
			
			(Chorus)
			
			(Verse 2)
			That was easy, but ya'll knew that
			How about a challenge now? You know I had to do that.
			What if the numbers mixed? What do you do then?
			Just do the same thing as in verse 1 again?
			Can't do that or the numbers will get scrambled
			How 'bout a problem? Take this one for example:
			Like 4 2/3 times 2 ¼
			Make 'em both improper fractions of course!
			14/3 times 9 over 4
			Before you multiply, you can simplify some more.
			Connect your numbers with one big x
			Then simplify those fractions using GCF's
			7 over 1 times 3 over 2
			multiply those numbers, and you're almost through
			21/2 makes 10 ½ 
			Now sing the chorus so you'll really learn this math.
			
			(Chorus)
			With the numbers in the numerator
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			and the ones in the denominator.
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			When you multiplyin' fractions just
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			I got the temp turned down and my SmartBoard's gone
			and the only way to learn is listen to this song
			
			(Verse 3)
			Now we're multiplyin, is there more to do?
			Let us take a sec and have a short review.
			If a number's mixed change it to improper.
			Then you simplify, c'mon boy do it proper.
			Multiply across, yeah that's what we sing.
			We can get these problems done before the bell rings.
			3/8 times 4 over 5
			Simplify 'em first before you multiply.
			3 and the 5, those'll stay the same.
			8 and the 4? Those'll surely change.
			Now 3 over 2 times 1 over 5.
			You get 3 over 10 after you multiply.
			You can times first and simplify it later
			but you may need to go and grab a calculator.
			When you learn with Murf, you can't go wrong.
			And if you forget, just sing this little song:
			
			(Chorus)
			With the numbers in the numerator
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			and the ones in the denominator.
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			When you multiplyin' fractions just
			Multiply across, multiply across, multiply across
			I got the temp turned down and my SmartBoard's gone
			and the only way to learn is listen to this song
