		<p id="transcipts">Here’s an example of subtracting fractions in the real world. 

		Take a look at my kitchen. I am practicing some baking to get ready for Thanksgiving this year and I tried making some brownies but I accidentally switched the oil and the water. I put 3/4 oil instead of 2/3.  I have these really nifty measuring cups but I got them mixed up. I need to find out how much extra oil I put in there to see if I should try baking it anyway or if it’s just way too much oil. How would I figure this out? Subtracting these two fractions of course! Let’s figure out how to subtract these to fractions. So first off can I just subtract 3 minus 2 and then 4 minus 3? No, I can’t do that because if you notice the denominators are not the same. Anytime they are not the same then you CANNOT do anything to the problem. We have to change those denominators and get something where they match because if not then your going to get something like orange people that we talked about in an earlier module and we CANNOT do that. So we want to do our MEPS. So we are going to take our denominators because that’s what we want to change and we are going to do our multiples to see what they have in common. So if we do 4, 8, 12 and then we do our threes— 3, 6, 9 ,12. So we notice that they both have 12. So that’s going to give us our brand new denominator. We’re going to take our 3/4 and our 2/3 and we are going to give them brand new denominators of 12. Now we can’t just stick the three and two on top of the new denominators because they have to do a little bit of changing too. So what did we do to the three to get to the 12? Well we multiplied by four to give us 12. Whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the top. So two times four is eight. So we have a new fraction of 8/12. We have to do the same thing to the 3/4. What did we do to the four to get to 12? Well, we multiplied times three and whatever you do to the bottom you must do to the top. So three times three is nine and we get 9/12 - 8/12. So we bring our brand new problem over here and remember we are subtracting. And so we have 9/12 - 8/12, which now the denominators match and when the denominators match you leave them alone. So there’s no 12 minus 12 is zero it’s just 12. The denominator will stay the same. It will not be subtracted. But the top will! Nine minus eight is one. So we are only add just a tiny bit of extra oil 1/12. So I think we are going to go ahead and cook these brownies and see how they come out. Did I mention I’m not that good a baking so fingers crossed we will see how it turns out.
