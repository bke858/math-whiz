		Hey guys! Let’s look at a problem where we have two fractions that we need to add but the denominators are not the same. 
			Remember the rule: if the denominators are different you CANNOT add them! 
			Instead, you have to do MEPS 
			The M is for our Big Fat M where we do our mountain multiples
			Our E is for equivalent fractions (which is step two)
			The P is the new problem that we will be able to solve
			And S is for simplify if possible 
			
			So let’s take our 9/12 and our 2/8 
			We are trying to get a new denominator so we are working with our denominators of 12 and 8
			Let’s do our multiples of 8 8—16
			12—24 
			8—16—24
			Oh yes we found something they have in common. This is our LCD (Least Common Denominator)
			Now we take these old fractions of 9/12 and 2/8 and we have to give them brand new denominators of 24
			So how do we do that with our equivalent fractions?
			8 x what gives you 24—times 3 right? Whatever we do to the bottom we MUST do to the top. 
			So 2 x 3 is 6.
			What about 12 to 24? What did we have to do? Times 2 equals 24. Whatever we do to the bottom we MUST do to the top. 9 x 2 is 18. 
			So now we have these BRAND NEW fractions 18/24 plus 6/24 and we add them together which gives us 24/24
			And can you simplify? OH YES! This simplifies to 1 whole. 
			Watch this video as many times as you need to remember the steps, but in the end it’s just MEPS—Big Fat M, Equivalent Fractions, Set up your new problem, and simplify. 
			Good LUCK!
